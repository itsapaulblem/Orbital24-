BLANK TEXT, IF SEEN, SOMETHING IS WRONG
-
Why brings you to me territory?!?
I have no idea who stole your treasure ...
Flee now or be attacked! 
-
AHHHH, i swear it wasn't me ... it really wasn't
I saw a fishy figure coming out of Finlayâ€™s house and entering your home ...
... then stealthily leaving soon after.
Now leave me alone!
