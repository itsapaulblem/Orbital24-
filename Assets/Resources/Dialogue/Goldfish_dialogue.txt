Gooood Morning! How was your sleep?
How terrible! It must be that dastardly Ezekill's deed !!
That explains all the broken pots and trashed coral gardens. 
You want to go and retrieve your treasure?
Then you must gear up, no point losing a tentacle with no reason, right?

Hey! Could you help me collect some stuff from the Seagrass Valley?
The Blue Bloodstone, A Vial of Salty Brine, and A Luminous Pearl.
They are hidden behind various challenges, help me retrieve them.

Thank you for retrieving {0}!
